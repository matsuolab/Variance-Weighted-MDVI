# Regularization and Variance-Weighted Regression Achieves Minimax Optimality in Linear MDPs: Theory and Practice

This repository contains a collection of reproduction codes for the experiments described in Section 7 of the paper [Regularization and Variance-Weighted Regression Achieves Minimax Optimality in Linear MDPs: Theory and Practice](TODO).

## Requirements

First clone the repository with the following command. 

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Then move to the repository of each experiment and refer to its README.md.

Details of each experiment can be found in the following directories:

* VWLS-MDVI Experiment (Section 7.1): See [VWLS-MDVI](VWLS-MDVI) directory.
* Deep-Variance-Weighting in Maze (Section 7.2.1): See [Deep-Variance-Weighting-Maze](Deep-Variance-Weighting-Maze) directory.
* Deep-Variance-Weighting in MinAtar (Section 7.2.2): See [Deep-Variance-Weighting-MinAtar](Deep-Variance-Weighting-MinAtar) directory.
